Allows users to record their mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically as many times as they wants.

# Application
It's elegant to automate farming / repeating actions in games/ message sending if it needs to be repeated for a long time, and the script can be download and replay 

# Install instructions
You can download and run the installer/archive for your operating system (currently Windows ONLY, since I have no Linux laptop, if someone could help me to wrap up the project in Linux, I will highly appreciate you and grab a cup of coffee to you!)
