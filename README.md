Allows users to record their mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically as many times as they wants.

# Application
It's elegant to automate farming / repeating actions in games/ message sending if it needs to be repeated for a long time, and the script can be download and replay 

# Install instructions
You can download and run the installer/archive for your operating system (currently Windows ONLY, since I have no Linux laptop, if someone could help me to wrap up the project in Linux, I will highly appreciate you and grab a cup of coffee to you!)

# Tips
-When the user downloading the .exe, it might say that the .exe file is suspicious and might be a malware, because I have no proper license. Don't worry, just go ahead and normally install it! (Trust me)
-BTW, the reference or the thought of the project is derived from atbswp: https://github.com/RMPR/atbswp; and the UI image is drawn by my friend: Andy. Thanks for the contribution to this project!
